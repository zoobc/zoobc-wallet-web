      <p>
        Local Storage, including Javascript-enabled localStorage, is a typical way for a website to store a
        small file of letters and numbers in your browser. We use Local Storage to assign you a unique user ID
        for purposes of communication with you. Local Storage are deleted when the website that stored them
        deletes them. You can also delete Local Storage from your browser at any time you like by visiting
        your web browser settings.
