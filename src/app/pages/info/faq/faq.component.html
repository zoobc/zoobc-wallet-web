          What is the difference between balance and spendable balance?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p><b>Balance</b> is how much zbc you have currently, regardless if you still have unconfirmed zbc.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spendable balance</b> is how much zbc you have minus unconfirmed zbc you have. So you can't send 5
        ZBC if you have 3 ZBC in spendable balance, even though you have 10 ZBC in balance

        ZooBC transaction can't be reversed. If you send ZBC to the wrong address by mistake it cannot be
        recovered.
